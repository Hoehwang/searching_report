              <Attribute Type="Description">Heils et al. (1995, 1996) reported that a polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (referred to as 5-HTTLPR) is located approximately 1 kb upstream of the SLC6A4 transcription initiation site and is composed of 16 repeat elements. The polymorphism consists of a 44-bp insertion or deletion involving repeat elements 6 to 8. The frequency of the long allele was found by Lesch et al. (1996) to be 57% and of the short allele 43%.</Attribute>

The L(G) allele, which is the L allele with a common A-to-G substitution (rs2553), creates a functional AP2 transcription factor (107580) binding site. Expression assays in 62 lymphoblastoid cell lines representing the 6 genotypes and in transfected raphe-derived cells showed codominant allele action and low, nearly equivalent expression for the S and L(G) alleles, accounting for more variation in HTT expression than previously recognized.</Attribute>

In a replication study in 175 trios consisting of probands with OCD and their parents, the L(A) allele was 2-fold overtransmitted to the patients with OCD. The HTTLPR L(A)L(A) genotype exerted a moderate (1.8-fold) effect on risk of OCD, thus establishing a role for the HTT gene in OCD.</Attribute>

Each group consisted of 14 adults. Hariri et al. (2002) concluded that their results demonstrated genetically driven variation in the response of brain regions underlying human emotional behavior and suggested that differential excitability of the amygdala to emotional stimuli may contribute to the increased fear and anxiety typically associated with the short SLC6A4 allele.</Attribute>

(2004) noted that at least 26 studies had investigated a putative association between the functional serotonin transporter 5-HTTLPR promoter polymorphism and anxiety-related personality traits, with inconsistent results. They conducted a metaanalysis of these studies, which included 5,629 individuals, and found suggestive evidence for an association between the short allele (S) and increased anxiety-related personality trait scores (p = 0.087). Analysis of heterogeneity revealed that substantial variation was introduced by the inventories used; when analyses were stratified by inventory type, there was a significant association between 5-HTTLPR and neuroticism as measured by the NEO personality inventory (p = 0.000016) but not by other rating scales. Sen et al. (2004) concluded that there is a strong association between the serotonin transporter promoter variant and neuroticism, and that nonreplications are largely due to small sample size and use of different inventories.</Attribute>

(2002) studied the frequency of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism, the V158M polymorphism of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; 116790.0001), and a splice site polymorphism (IVS7+218C-A) of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH; 191060) in a case-control association study of bipolar disorder patients with or without lifetime panic disorder. They compared results from DNA extracted from blood leukocytes of 111 unrelated subjects of Italian descent meeting DSM-III-R criteria for bipolar disorder, including 49 with and 62 without comorbid lifetime panic disorder, with those of 127 healthy subjects. Relative to the comparison subjects, subjects with bipolar disorder without panic disorder, but not those with comorbid bipolar disorder and panic disorder, showed significantly higher frequencies of the COMT met158 and the short 5-HTTLPR alleles. No statistical significance was found between the bipolar disorder groups and the TPH polymorphism. Rotondo et al. (2002) concluded that bipolar disorder without panic disorder may represent a more homogeneous form of illness and that variants of the COMT and SLC6A4 genes may influence clinical features of bipolar disorder.</Attribute>

For each polymorphism, the authors assessed the evidence for allelic association, heterogeneity among studies, the influence of individual studies, and the potential for publication bias. The short alleles of the 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism showed a significant association with bipolar disorder (OR = 1.13, p = 0.001) but not unipolar disorder.

Seventeen population-based studies comprising 1,712 cases and 2,583 controls and 6 family-based studies comprising 587 trios were included in the 5-HTTLPR metaanalysis. Sixteen population-based studies comprising 1,764 cases and 2,703 controls as well as for family-based studies comprising 382 trios were included in the intron 2 VNTR metaanalysis.

              <Attribute Type="Description">In a prospective-longitudinal study of a representative birth cohort, Caspi et al. (2003) tested why stressful experiences led to depression (608516) in some people but not in others. The functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene was found to moderate the influence of stressful life events on depression. Individuals with 1 or 2 copies of the short allele of the promoter polymorphism exhibited more depressive symptoms, diagnosable depression, and suicidality in relation to stressful life events than individuals homozygous for the long allele. The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study Cohort was used for this study. It consists of a birth cohort of 1,037 children, of whom 52% were male, that was assessed at ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, and 21 and was virtually intact at the age of 26 years. A total of 847 Caucasian non-Maori study members were divided into 3 groups on the basis of their genotype. There was no difference in genotype frequencies between the sexes. Stressful life events occurring after the 21st birthday and before the 26th birthday were assessed with the aid of a life-history calendar, a highly reliable method for ascertaining life event histories. Thirty percent of the study members experienced no stressful life events, 25% experienced 1 event, 20% 2 events, 11% 3 events, and 15% 4 or more events. There were no significant differences between the 3 genotype groups in the number of life events they experienced, suggesting that the serotonin transporter genotype did not influence exposure to stressful life events. In a hierarchical logistic regression model, the main effect of genotype was not significant, the main effect of number of life events was significant, and the interaction between genotype and number of life events was significant. Caspi et al. (2003) concluded that their epidemiologic study provided evidence of a gene-by-environment interaction, in which an individual's response to environmental insults is moderated by his or her genetic makeup.</Attribute>

No difference between patients and controls was found for genotype distribution and allele frequency. However, genotype distribution and allele frequencies were strongly associated with DSM-IV depressive subtypes such that melancholic depression was associated with the long allele and atypical depression with the short allele (2-sided Fisher exact test: genotype distribution, p = 0.0038; allele frequencies: p = 0.007).

Carriers of the short allele had highly significant reduction of amygdala-pACC connectivity, particularly with the rostral ACC, compared to carriers of the long allele. Pezawas et al.

Patients with the S allele treated with paroxetine showed a small impairment in antidepressant response. Among mirtazapine-treated patients, there was little indication that the promoter polymorphism affected antidepressant efficacy; however, the promoter polymorphism had a dramatic effect on adverse events. Among paroxetine-treated patients, S allele carriers experienced significantly more severe adverse events, achieved significantly lower final daily doses, and had more discontinuations. Mirtazapine-treated patients had the opposite finding: S allele carriers had significantly fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, experienced less severe adverse events, and achieved higher final daily doses.

Inhibitors of 5-HTT attenuated the growth-stimulatory effects of serum and serotonin. Expression of 5-HTT was increased in cultured pulmonary artery SMCs as well as in platelets and lungs from patients with PPH, where it predominated in the media of thickened pulmonary arteries and in onion bulb lesions. The L allele of the 5-HTT promoter, which is associated with 5-HTT overexpression and increased pulmonary artery SMC growth, was present in homozygous form in 65% of PPH patients but in only 27% of controls (p less than 0.001).
