              <Attribute Type="Description">In 3 affected brothers from a consanguineous Iranian family segregating autosomal recessive nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness (DFNB98; 614861), Delmaghani et al. (2012) identified homozygosity for 2 adjacent variants in exon 10 of the TSPEAR gene, a 1726G-T transversion and a 1-bp deletion (1728delC), predicted to result in termination of translation in the sixth EAR repeat (Val576LeufsTer37). The unaffected parents and 2 unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the mutations, which were not found in 152 Iranian controls or 200 French controls. In transfection studies in HEK293 cells, both wildtype and mutant proteins were detected in cell lysates, but only the wildtype form was detected in the culture media, indicating defective secretion of the mutant protein. Immunocytofluorescence analysis of transfected COS-7 cells showed that the mutated TSPEAR was restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum next to the nucleus, indicating abnormal intracellular trafficking of the truncated form.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In 2 female cousins from a consanguineous Arab Muslim family (family A) with ectodermal dysplasia-14, hair/tooth type with hypohidrosis (ECTD14; 618180), Peled et al. (2016) identified homozygosity for the c.1726G-T transversion, predicted to result in a val576-to-phe (V576F) substitution, and the adjacent deletion (c.1728delC), causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The authors noted that the 2 mutations were likely to be in linkage disequilibrium, and that although significance of the V576F mutation was unclear, its functional consequence was likely to be marginal, given the predicted effect of the adjacent frameshift mutation. Both patients had normal hearing by audiometric testing. An unrelated male patient (family B) with ectodermal dysplasia was found to be compound heterozygous for the adjacent transversion and deletion mutations and a 4-bp deletion (c.454_457delCTGG; 612920.0002) in TSPEAR, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon (Leu152TrpfsTer28). PCR-RFLP assays confirmed segregation of the mutations with disease in both families. Neither mutation was found in 309 or 294 population-matched controls, respectively, and the 4-bp deletion was not found in the ESP, ExAC, or 1000 Genomes Project databases, whereas the 1-bp deletion was present in heterozygous state in 3 of 60,032 individuals tested. Because immunostaining of patient skin biopsy showed decreased NOTCH1 (190198) expression, the authors hypothesized that TSPEAR mutations exert a loss-of-function effect mediated through NOTCH1.</Attribute>

(2018) identified homozygosity for the previously reported complex mutation (c.1726_1728delGTCinsTT) in exon 10 of the TSPEAR gene, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon (Val576LeufsTer38) within the EAR6 domain. The authors noted that the complex variant could be represented as a simultaneous substitution and deletion (c.1726G-T; c.1728delC). The proband's unaffected first-cousin parents and sister were each heterozygous for the complex allele, which was present at low minor allele frequency (MAF of 1.1 x 10(-3)) in an in-house database of about 1,000 Turkish exomes, as well as in the ExAC and gnomAD databases (MAFs of 2.5 x 10(-5) and 2.8 x 10(-5), respectively); neither variant was found to occur independently of the other. In addition to lacking 20 permanent teeth, the proband exhibited microcephaly and facial dysmorphisms including narrow forehead, increased hair growth on the forehead, high-arched palate, low-set ears.</Attribute>

(2012) identified homozygosity for 2 adjacent variants in exon 10 of the TSPEAR gene, a 1726G-T transversion and a 1-bp deletion (1728delC), predicted to result in termination of translation in the sixth EAR repeat (Val576LeufsTer37). The unaffected parents and 2 unaffected sisters were heterozygous for the mutations, which were not found in 152 Iranian controls or 200 French controls. In transfection studies in HEK293 cells, both wildtype and mutant proteins were detected in cell lysates, but only the wildtype form was detected in the culture media, indicating defective secretion of the mutant protein. Immunocytofluorescence analysis of transfected COS-7 cells showed that the mutated TSPEAR was restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum next to the nucleus, indicating abnormal intracellular trafficking of the truncated form.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In 2 female cousins from a consanguineous Arab Muslim family (family A) with ectodermal dysplasia-14, hair/tooth type with hypohidrosis (ECTD14; 618180), Peled et al. (2016) identified homozygosity for the c.1726G-T transversion, predicted to result in a val576-to-phe (V576F) substitution, and the adjacent deletion (c.1728delC), causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The authors noted that the 2 mutations were likely to be in linkage disequilibrium, and that although significance of the V576F mutation was unclear, its functional consequence was likely to be marginal, given the predicted effect of the adjacent frameshift mutation. Both patients had normal hearing by audiometric testing. An unrelated male patient (family B) with ectodermal dysplasia was found to be compound heterozygous for the adjacent transversion and deletion mutations and a 4-bp deletion (c.454_457delCTGG; 612920.0002) in TSPEAR, causing a frameshift predicted to result in a premature termination codon (Leu152TrpfsTer28). PCR-RFLP assays confirmed segregation of the mutations with disease in both families. Neither mutation was found in 309 or 294 population-matched controls, respectively, and the 4-bp deletion was not found in the ESP, ExAC, or 1000 Genomes Project databases, whereas the 1-bp deletion was present in heterozygous state in 3 of 60,032 individuals tested. Because immunostaining of patient skin biopsy showed decreased NOTCH1 (190198) expression, the authors hypothesized that TSPEAR mutations exert a loss-of-function effect mediated through NOTCH1.</Attribute>

The authors noted that the complex variant could be represented as a simultaneous substitution and deletion (c.1726G-T; c.1728delC). The proband's unaffected first-cousin parents and sister were each heterozygous for the complex allele, which was present at low minor allele frequency (MAF of 1.1 x 10(-3)) in an in-house database of about 1,000 Turkish exomes, as well as in the ExAC and gnomAD databases (MAFs of 2.5 x 10(-5) and 2.8 x 10(-5), respectively); neither variant was found to occur independently of the other. In addition to lacking 20 permanent teeth, the proband exhibited microcephaly and facial dysmorphisms including narrow forehead, increased hair growth on the forehead, high-arched palate, low-set ears.</Attribute>
