                <Attribute Type="public definition">Cystinosis comprises three allelic phenotypes: Nephropathic cystinosis in untreated children is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome, poor growth, hypophosphatemic/calcipenic rickets, impaired glomerular function resulting in complete glomerular failure, and accumulation of cystine in almost all cells, leading to cellular dysfunction with tissue and organ impairment. The typical untreated child has short stature, rickets, and photophobia. Failure to thrive is generally noticed after approximately age six months; signs of renal tubular Fanconi syndrome (polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and acidosis) appear as early as age six months; corneal crystals can be present before age one year and are always present after age 16 months. Prior to the use of renal transplantation and cystine-depleting therapy, the life span in nephropathic cystinosis was no longer than ten years. With these interventions, affected individuals can survive at least into the mid-forties or fifties with satisfactory quality of life. Intermediate cystinosis is characterized by all the typical manifestations of nephropathic cystinosis, but onset is at a later age. Renal glomerular failure occurs in all untreated affected individuals, usually between ages 15 and 25 years. The non-nephropathic (ocular) form of cystinosis is characterized clinically only by photophobia resulting from corneal cystine crystal accumulation.</Attribute>

                <Attribute Type="public definition">Cystinosis comprises three allelic phenotypes: Nephropathic cystinosis in untreated children is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome, poor growth, hypophosphatemic/calcipenic rickets, impaired glomerular function resulting in complete glomerular failure, and accumulation of cystine in almost all cells, leading to cellular dysfunction with tissue and organ impairment. The typical untreated child has short stature, rickets, and photophobia. Failure to thrive is generally noticed after approximately age six months; signs of renal tubular Fanconi syndrome (polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, and acidosis) appear as early as age six months; corneal crystals can be present before age one year and are always present after age 16 months. Prior to the use of renal transplantation and cystine-depleting therapy, the life span in nephropathic cystinosis was no longer than ten years. With these interventions, affected individuals can survive at least into the mid-forties or fifties with satisfactory quality of life. Intermediate cystinosis is characterized by all the typical manifestations of nephropathic cystinosis, but onset is at a later age. Renal glomerular failure occurs in all untreated affected individuals, usually between ages 15 and 25 years. The non-nephropathic (ocular) form of cystinosis is characterized clinically only by photophobia resulting from corneal cystine crystal accumulation.</Attribute>

(2000) sequenced 200 kb surrounding the CTNS gene and found that the deletion is approximately 57 rather than 65 kb. The authors identified SHPK (605060), which they designated CARKL, within this deleted region.

Among American-based patients studied by Shotelersuk et al. (1998), 48 (44%) of 108 were homozygous for the 65-kb 'European' deletion. Of 96 alleles from these patients, 82 were assigned a nation of origin; 38 (46%) derived from Germany and 28 (34%) arose from the British Isles. Two apparently unrelated patients with homozygous deletions came from Iceland. In addition to the 48 patients homozygous for the 65-kb deletion, many of the patients may have a single copy of the deletion. An upstream deletion breakpoint needed to be determined before a PCR-based test of heterozygosity for the deletion could be developed.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">This common mutation in nephropathic cystinosis (219800) was originally reported as a 65-kb deletion. Touchman et al. (2000) sequenced 200 kb surrounding the CTNS gene and found that the deletion is approximately 57 rather than 65 kb. The authors identified SHPK (605060), which they designated CARKL, within this deleted region. The findings indicated that the 57-kb deletion includes deletion of CARKL in addition to CTNS, which may account for phenotypic variability in patients.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In a French/British report (Town et al., 1998), 23 (33%) of 70 patients with nephropathic cystinosis had a 65-kb deletion in the CTNS gene. Among American-based patients studied by Shotelersuk et al. (1998), 48 (44%) of 108 were homozygous for the 65-kb 'European' deletion. Of 96 alleles from these patients, 82 were assigned a nation of origin; 38 (46%) derived from Germany and 28 (34%) arose from the British Isles. Two apparently unrelated patients with homozygous deletions came from Iceland. In addition to the 48 patients homozygous for the 65-kb deletion, many of the patients may have a single copy of the deletion. An upstream deletion breakpoint needed to be determined before a PCR-based test of heterozygosity for the deletion could be developed.</Attribute>

(Shotelersuk et al., 1998) and spread by migration to other regions, including Iceland.</Attribute>

Enzyme studies of cultured fibroblasts revealed an 80% reduction in sedoheptulose phosphorylating activity compared to cystinosis patients with other mutations and controls. The findings indicated that the CARKL gene encodes sedoheptulokinase, which functions in the pentose phosphate pathway.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Buntinx et al. (2016) noted that the most common mutation in Northern European patients with cystinosis is the 57-kb deletion in the CTNS gene. This deletion extends into the noncoding region upstream of the start codon of the TRPV1 gene (602076), which encodes a capsaicin- and heat-sensitive ion channel. Buntinx et al. (2016) found that patients heterozygous for the deletion showed normal sensory responses, whereas patients homozygous for the mutation exhibited a 60% reduction in vasodilation and pain evoked by capsaicin, as well as an increase in heat detection threshold. Responses to cold, mechanical stimuli, or cinnamaldehyde, a TRPA1 (604775) agonist, were unaltered. Buntinx et al. (2016) concluded that cystinosis patients homozygous for the 57-kb CTNS deletion have a strong reduction of TRPV1 function, possibly accounting for sensory alterations and thermoregulatory deficits in these patients.</Attribute>

          <Comment>Evidence considered in support of pathogenic classification: - This intragenic copy number variant (CNV) results in the deletion of exons 1-9 and part of exon 10 (of 11) of the CTNS gene. This CNV also spans the SHPK gene and part of the TRPV1 gene. Neither of the SHPK nor TRPV1 genes have a strong association to disease (OMIM, PanelApp) - Variant is present in gnomAD (SV v2.1) &lt;0.01 for a recessive condition (10 heterozygotes, 0 homozygotes). - Other loss-of-function variants comparable to the one identified in this case (including both intragenic CNVs and variants resulting in a premature termination codon) have very strong previous evidence for pathogenicity (OMIM, Decipher, PMID: 15365816, PMID: 30949462). - This variant has strong previous evidence of pathogenicity in unrelated individuals. This variant is the most common pathogenic variant among Northern European populations, and has been reported in many homozygous individuals with nephropathic cystinosis (PMID: 10673275, PMID: 15365816, PMID: 30949462, PMID: 31570786). Additional information: - Loss of function is a known mechanism of disease in this gene and is associated with nephropathic cystinosis (MIM#219800). - This gene is associated with autosomal recessive disease. - This variant is homozygous. - This variant has been shown to be both maternally and paternally inherited (biallelic) (by trio analysis).</Comment>
