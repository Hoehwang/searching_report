                <Attribute Type="public definition">Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent acute sensory and motor neuropathy in a single or multiple nerves. The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Using DNA markers, Chance et al. (1993) demonstrated a large interstitial deletion in distal 17p11.2 in persons with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP; 162500), also called 'bulb diggers' palsy,' in 3 unrelated kindreds. In 1 pedigree, de novo genesis of the deletion was documented. The deletion spanned approximately 1.5 Mb and included all markers that were known to be duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A; 118220). The deleted region appeared uniform in all pedigrees and included the PMP22 gene. Since the breakpoints in hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsy and CMT1A map to the same intervals in 17p11.2, one can conclude that these genetic disorders may be the result of reciprocal products of unequal crossingover. Lorenzetti et al. (1995) studied 9 unrelated Italian families with HNPP identified on the basis of clinical, electrophysiologic, and histologic evaluations. In all 9 families, Southern blot analysis indicated deletion of 1 copy of the probe used in the HNPP patients. Deletion was also indicated by typing with a polymorphic (CA)n repeat and with 3 RFLPs, all known to map within the deleted region. These findings suggested that a 1.5-Mb deletion is the most common mutation associated with HNPP.</Attribute>

(1995) analyzed EcoRI-digested DNA from 30 unrelated patients by hybridization with appropriate probes. In this large series, the HNPP phenotype, determined by clinical and electrophysiologic criteria, was associated with a 17p11.2 deletion in 90% (27/30) of the patients. The 3 patients who did not carry the CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit deletion may have had mutations in the PMP22 gene or possibly in the P-zero gene (159440).</Attribute>

Korn-Lubetzki et al. (2002) described a father and 2 daughters of Jewish Kurdish origin who developed inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy within 10 years of each other. DNA analysis in the father and 1 daughter who was available for study revealed a 1.5-kb deletion of the PMP22 gene. The father presented at the age of 50 years with asymmetric distal involvement of the legs and right hand following surgery. Demyelination was demonstrated by sural nerve biopsy. Each of his 2 daughters presented at the age of 24 years with asymmetric distal involvement of the legs and left hand. Neither the father nor the daughters had evidence of preceding trauma or compression.</Attribute>

The nonconsanguineous parents were each heterozygous for a deletion and showed an HNPP phenotype. Al-Thihli et al. (2008) used multiplex ligation probe-dependent amplification (MLPA) to determine the breakpoints of the deletions. The 1.5-Mb deletion, which the authors stated was the 'typical' HNPP-associated deletion, included the neighboring TEKT3 (612683) and COX10 (602125) genes.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Saporta et al. (2011) reported a 7-year-old boy, born of consanguineous parents, with a homozygous 1.1-Mb deletion of chromosome 17p including all 5 exons of the PMP22 gene, the TEKT3 gene, and the FLJ gene, but not the COX10 gene. The deletion was identified by MLPA. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the deletion and had electrophysiologic features of HNPP. The boy was first noted to have hypotonia at age 4 months, and later showed delayed walking with an unsteady sensory ataxic gait requiring a walker. He had distal weakness of the hands and distal sensory impairment with areflexia. He also had bilateral facial weakness, mild ptosis, and mild hammertoes, but no pes cavus. Interestingly, he had no atrophy or weakness of the muscles in the limbs, suggesting normal motor function, although electrophysiologic studies showed slowed peroneal motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve sensory responses were unobtainable. Skin biopsy showed a reduction in myelinated fiber density, with noncompact myelin, axonal loss, and redundancy of the basal lamina around or near Schwann cells. Saporta et al. (2011) noted that this was the first reported patient with complete homozygous deletion of the PMP22 gene. The authors suggested that lack of PMP22's normal differential expression in motor and sensory axons during development contributed to the patient's phenotype of predominantly large fiber sensory loss with nonlength-dependent mild motor impairment.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Using DNA markers, Chance et al. (1993) demonstrated a large interstitial deletion in distal 17p11.2 in persons with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP; 162500), also called 'bulb diggers' palsy,' in 3 unrelated kindreds. In 1 pedigree, de novo genesis of the deletion was documented. The deletion spanned approximately 1.5 Mb and included all markers that were known to be duplicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A; 118220). The deleted region appeared uniform in all pedigrees and included the PMP22 gene. Since the breakpoints in hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsy and CMT1A map to the same intervals in 17p11.2, one can conclude that these genetic disorders may be the result of reciprocal products of unequal crossingover. Lorenzetti et al. (1995) studied 9 unrelated Italian families with HNPP identified on the basis of clinical, electrophysiologic, and histologic evaluations. In all 9 families, Southern blot analysis indicated deletion of 1 copy of the probe used in the HNPP patients. Deletion was also indicated by typing with a polymorphic (CA)n repeat and with 3 RFLPs, all known to map within the deleted region. These findings suggested that a 1.5-Mb deletion is the most common mutation associated with HNPP.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">To evaluate the frequency of 17p11.2 deletion involving a rearrangement in the CMT1A-REP (the 2 homologous sequences flanking the 1.5-Mb CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit), LeGuern et al. (1995) analyzed EcoRI-digested DNA from 30 unrelated patients by hybridization with appropriate probes. In this large series, the HNPP phenotype, determined by clinical and electrophysiologic criteria, was associated with a 17p11.2 deletion in 90% (27/30) of the patients. The 3 patients who did not carry the CMT1A/HNPP monomer unit deletion may have had mutations in the PMP22 gene or possibly in the P-zero gene (159440).</Attribute>

Korn-Lubetzki et al. (2002) described a father and 2 daughters of Jewish Kurdish origin who developed inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy within 10 years of each other. DNA analysis in the father and 1 daughter who was available for study revealed a 1.5-kb deletion of the PMP22 gene. The father presented at the age of 50 years with asymmetric distal involvement of the legs and right hand following surgery. Demyelination was demonstrated by sural nerve biopsy. Each of his 2 daughters presented at the age of 24 years with asymmetric distal involvement of the legs and left hand. Neither the father nor the daughters had evidence of preceding trauma or compression.</Attribute>

The nonconsanguineous parents were each heterozygous for a deletion and showed an HNPP phenotype. Al-Thihli et al.

              <Attribute Type="Description">Saporta et al. (2011) reported a 7-year-old boy, born of consanguineous parents, with a homozygous 1.1-Mb deletion of chromosome 17p including all 5 exons of the PMP22 gene, the TEKT3 gene, and the FLJ gene, but not the COX10 gene. The deletion was identified by MLPA. Each unaffected parent was heterozygous for the deletion and had electrophysiologic features of HNPP. The boy was first noted to have hypotonia at age 4 months, and later showed delayed walking with an unsteady sensory ataxic gait requiring a walker. He had distal weakness of the hands and distal sensory impairment with areflexia. He also had bilateral facial weakness, mild ptosis, and mild hammertoes, but no pes cavus. Interestingly, he had no atrophy or weakness of the muscles in the limbs, suggesting normal motor function, although electrophysiologic studies showed slowed peroneal motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve sensory responses were unobtainable. Skin biopsy showed a reduction in myelinated fiber density, with noncompact myelin, axonal loss, and redundancy of the basal lamina around or near Schwann cells. Saporta et al. (2011) noted that this was the first reported patient with complete homozygous deletion of the PMP22 gene. The authors suggested that lack of PMP22's normal differential expression in motor and sensory axons during development contributed to the patient's phenotype of predominantly large fiber sensory loss with nonlength-dependent mild motor impairment.</Attribute>
