      <Comment DataSource="NCBI curation" Type="public">NCBI staff could not provide an HGVS expression for 300377.0002 because the affected site was not specified.  Although PCR failed to amplify a product when the primer corresponding to NG_012232.1:g.132621_132648 was used, the primer was able to hybridize.  The NsiI site between NG_012232.1:g.132642 and NG_012232.1:g.132647 was also lost. "The defect, therefore, appeared to be at the PmF annealing site. The mutation was localised to the 3' end of the primer binding site by the demonstration that the PmF oligonucleotide was able to hybridise normally to the DNA of patient 5 by dot blot analysis, whereas PCR amplification was prevented. This was confirmed by the loss of the expected Nsil site there, " Bushby et al. (1991), PubMed 1757094.</Comment>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In 1 of 7 patients with Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD; 300376) in whom analysis of dystrophin by immunoblotting showed a full-sized molecule produced in reduced abundance compared with controls, Bushby et al. (1991) found absence of one of the expected fragments from the promoter region of the DMD gene. They had used PCR with 3 sets of primers within the promoter region, followed by dot blot and restriction analysis. A large deletion was excluded by the finding of normal-sized fragments on amplification with the other primer sets. The patient had no family history of muscle disease, and early motor milestones and mobility were entirely normal. From the age of 5 years, however, he had experienced cramping muscle pains in his calves and thighs, severe enough to limit his exercise potential. The pains were not associated with contractures and cleared in approximately 1 hour on resting as a child, although at the age of 35 they could persist for up to 24 hours. Exceptionally heavy exercise was associated with the passage of dark urine, but myoglobinuria was never proven. From his mid-teens, he also experienced pain in his hands and shoulders on heavy lifting. The severity and persistence of cramps resembled those in the family described by Gospe et al. (1989). No muscle weakness was noticed until the age of about 30 when he began to have difficulty climbing stairs. This weakness was slowly progressive; at age 40 he had mildly lordotic gait and required 2 railings to climb stairs and support on his thighs to rise from a chair or the floor. Serum CPK levels were very high and an electrocardiogram showed incomplete right bundle branch block and Q waves in leads III and aVR. Dystrophin was still produced at 73% of normal abundance, suggesting either that the promoter retains its function at reduced efficiency or that there are additional sequences that can control dystrophin expression in muscle. Boyce et al. (1991) also identified an individual with specific deletion of the dystrophin muscle promoter, giving rise to Becker muscular dystrophy.</Attribute>
