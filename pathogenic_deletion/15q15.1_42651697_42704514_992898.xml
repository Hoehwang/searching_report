                <Attribute Type="public definition">Calpainopathy is characterized by symmetric and progressive weakness of proximal limb-girdle muscles. The age at onset of muscle weakness ranges from two to 40 years. The phenotype shows intra- and interfamilial variability ranging from severe to mild. Three autosomal recessive calpainopathy phenotypes have been identified based on the distribution of muscle weakness and age at onset: Pelvifemoral limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) (Leyden-Möbius LGMD) phenotype, the most frequently observed calpainopathy phenotype, in which muscle weakness is first evident in the pelvic girdle and later in the shoulder girdle, with onset that may occur as early as before age 12 years or as late as after age 30 years. Scapulohumeral LGMD (Erb LGMD) phenotype, usually a milder phenotype with infrequent early onset, in which muscle weakness is first evident in the shoulder girdle and later in the pelvic girdle. HyperCKemia, usually observed in children or young individuals, in which individuals are asymptomatic and have high serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations. The autosomal dominant form of calpainopathy shows a variability of clinical phenotype, ranging from almost asymptomatic to wheelchair dependence after age 60 years in few cases with a generally milder phenotype than the recessive form. Clinical findings of calpainopathy include the tendency to walk on tiptoe, difficulty in running, scapular winging, waddling gait, and slight hyperlordosis. Other findings include symmetric weakness of proximal more than distal muscles in the limbs, trunk, and periscapular area; laxity of the abdominal muscles; Achilles tendon shortening; scoliosis; and joint contractures. Affected individuals typically do not have cardiac involvement or intellectual disability.</Attribute>

          <Comment>The c.2201_2202delAT/p.(Tyr734*) occurred in exon 21 of CAPN3 (NM_000070.2) , which caused a variant at site 734 of the encoded protein that converted a tyrosine residue into a stop codon, which may cause protein truncation or activate nonsense-mediated CAPN3 mRNA degradation, thereby affecting the function of the protein product encoded by CAPN3 (PVS1). This variant was not detected in the normal population database (PM2); in the trans-position, the pathogenic variant c.2201_2202delAT/p.(Tyr734*) was detected (PM3). According to the 2015 ACMG guidelines for sequence variant interpretation, this variant is defined as pathogenic (PVS1+PM2+PM3). The WES of our patient revealed compound heterozygous variants in CAPN3, c.2120A&gt;G/p. (Asp707Gly) in exon 20 and c.2201_2202delAT/p.(Tyr734*) in exon 21, which were inherited from his parents and absent from 200 control individuals of similar ethnic origin, indicating that these variants are the pathogenic triggers of the LGMDR1 phenotype. In summary, we observed a sporadic male case of LGMDR1 and identified two compound heterozygous variants in CAPN3, namely c.2120A&gt;G/p. (Asp707Gly) and c.2201_2202delAT/ p.(Tyr734*)), which co-segregated with the LGMDR1 phenotypes in the probandâ€™s family.</Comment>

              <Description>WES technology was used to screen the mutated sites in CAPN3 (NM_000070.2, NP_000061.1). WES was performed according to the human exome capture protocol from Illuminaâ€™s TruSeq Exome Enrichment Guide (SureSelectXT Target Enrichment System for Illumina Paired-End Sequencing Library, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The exome enrichment probe sets were constructed with the Agilent Human All Exon 50 Mb Exome Enrichment kit and sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 NGS platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The captured gDNA library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform, and 200 (2 Ã— 100) bp was generated from the final library fragment using V2 Reagent 1.8 software (Illumina; data after June 22, 2011). The average depth of the target area was 257.15, and the target bases with coverage of at least 50Ã— were 75.81%, 20Ã— were 82.23%, 10Ã— were 89.04%, 4Ã— were 93.56% and 1Ã— were 96.09%, respectively. After sequencing, low-quality variants were filtered out to obtain clean reads. Paired-end sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome hg19 with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner. Genome Analysis Toolkit software was used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions or deletions. All identified variants were submitted to ANNOVAR for functional annotation and genetic filtering. All information presented in this study was directly extracted from the reference data set or calculated in batches of all variants. Common variants were excluded by comparison with more than 1000 exomes sequenced in our laboratory for unrelated conditions and subsequently filtered with the dbSNP v137, 1000 Genomes Project, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Exome Sequencing Project, and ExAC databases. Variant filtration was based on the following criteria: (1) excluding untranslated region 3 and 5 variants, non-coding RNA intron variants, and intron and synonymous variants; (2) excluding minor allele frequency &gt;0.1 variants ; and (3) at least half of the harmful variants in the bioinformatics software (PolyPhen-2, SIFT and Variant Taster) were retained.</Description>

              <Comment>The proband was a sporadic case with no related symptoms manifesting in the parents. The proband was admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University for consistently elevated, although fluctuating, CK levels. The clinical course was as follows: the proband was found to have elevated CK (3000 Î¼g/L, physiological range 38â€“174 Î¼g/L) when he visited the hospital for a skin rash in 2015, without any muscle aches. Seven days later, the patient was admitted to the Department of Immunology of the hospital (CK: 2185 Î¼g/L) and was initially diagnosed as possible polymyositis; thus, he was administered hormone combined with immunosuppressive therapy. No evident therapeutic effect was observed, and his CK levels widely fluctuated during treatment. Until 2020, the patient presented no abnormalities, a normal walking posture, and regular squatting and stair climbing abilities and could lift heavy objects. As the elevated CK levels did not affect his everyday life, this condition was undiagnosed and remained untreated. On June 1, 2020, for the first time, the patient felt weakness in the left lower limb after several hours of driving. At that time, the CK level was 2091 Î¼g/L; except for slightly uneven shoulder blades, no muscular abnormalities were observed. The muscle volume was normal, and no evidently abnormal distribution was evidenced by muscle MRI. Twenty days later, the CK level was 11,262 Î¼g/L with no apparent reasons. After hormone therapy, the CK level decreased to 1179 Î¼g/L. In addition to increased CK, the patient also had increased total bilirubin (61.6 Î¼mol/L) and direct bilirubin (16.7 Î¼mol/L). Since disease onset, the patientâ€™s weight did not significantly vary, and no family member showed similar symptoms. Except for the persistently elevated CK level, the patient did not show numbness, tingling, or pain in his hands or feet, and other general physical symptoms were normal, including eating, urination, defecation, and cranial nerve function. He showed a normal cognitive function in the neuropsychological test via the Minor Mental State Examination. On physical examination, he presented approximately average muscle strength and volume. Muscle strength was graded according to the Medical Research Council scale: neck flexors 5-/5, neck extensors 5/5, bilateral shoulder abductors 5-/5, left elbow flexors/extensors 5/5, right elbow flexors/extensors 5/5, bilateral hip flexors/extensors, bilateral wrist flexors/extensors, knee flexors/extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors/plantar flexors 5-/5. No extraocular, facial, or bulbar muscle weakness or significant muscle atrophies were detected. Laboratory examination showed a regular blood routine, serum potassium, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level. Remarkably, the CK has been maintained at a high-level, reaching a maximum of 11,262 Î¼g/L, which is 50-fold higher than the physiological level and independent of symptom severity (Fig. 2). His CK-MB and lactate dehydrogenase increased to 96 and 356 Î¼g/L, respectively, which may cause inflammatory myositis. Electromyography examination showed no noticeable myopathy changes, including motor unit action potentials with short duration, small amplitude, and increased polyphasic potentials. Muscle MRI did not show abnormal signs of asymmetric muscle involvement. Muscle biopsy revealed a muscle tissue morphology consistent with normal muscle tissue, and the results of immunohistochemical staining were normal. Genetic testing was performed after LGMD was diagnosed.</Comment>
