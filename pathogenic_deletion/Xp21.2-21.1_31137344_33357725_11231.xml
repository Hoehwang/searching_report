                <Attribute Type="public definition">The dystrophinopathies cover a spectrum of X-linked muscle disease ranging from mild to severe that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The mild end of the spectrum includes the phenotypes of asymptomatic increase in serum concentration of creatine phosphokinase (CK) and muscle cramps with myoglobinuria. The severe end of the spectrum includes progressive muscle diseases that are classified as Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy when skeletal muscle is primarily affected and as DMD-associated DCM when the heart is primarily affected. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) usually presents in early childhood with delayed motor milestones including delays in walking independently and standing up from a supine position. Proximal weakness causes a waddling gait and difficulty climbing stairs, running, jumping, and standing up from a squatting position. DMD is rapidly progressive, with affected children being wheelchair dependent by age 12 years. Cardiomyopathy occurs in almost all individuals with DMD after age 18 years. Few survive beyond the third decade, with respiratory complications and progressive cardiomyopathy being common causes of death. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness. With improved diagnostic techniques, it has been recognized that the mild end of the spectrum includes men with onset of symptoms after age 30 years who remain ambulatory even into their 60s. Despite the milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from DCM is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death in BMD. Mean age of death is in the mid-40s. DMD-associated DCM is characterized by left ventricular dilation and congestive heart failure. Females heterozygous for a DMD pathogenic variant are at increased risk for DCM.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">In a family in which 4 brothers and 2 of their maternal uncles had dilated cardiomyopathy (CMD3B; 302045), Muntoni et al. (1993) described a deletion of the first muscle exon and the muscle-promoter region of the DMD gene. Although no skeletal muscle weakness was present, serum creatine kinase levels were elevated. They put forth the hypothesis that 'the brain promoter is driving relatively high levels of transcription in skeletal muscle but not in the heart.' Bies (1994) and Towbin and Ortiz-Lopez (1994) raised doubts that the muscle-promoter deletion was specific for cardiomyopathy. Muntoni et al. (1995) stated that the deletion did not remove the brain or Purkinje-cell promoters. Dystrophin was detected immunocytochemically in the skeletal muscle from the family of Muntoni et al. (1993), despite the fact that the deletion eliminated the transcriptional start site of the muscle isoform. In order to determine which promoter was driving dystrophin transcription in skeletal muscle of these individuals, Muntoni et al. (1995) first evaluated the expression of exon 1 of muscle, brain, and Purkinje-cell isoforms in normal human skeletal and cardiac muscles and in mouse brain and cerebellum. In normal patients, they found that, with the exception of minimal expression of the brain isoform, only the muscle isoform is significantly transcribed in skeletal muscle, whereas both the exon 1 muscle and brain isoforms are highly expressed in cardiac muscle. In contrast, the skeletal muscle of the patients with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy showed expression of both the brain and the Purkinje-cell isoforms. The overexpression of these 2 isoforms in skeletal muscle appeared to be of crucial importance in preventing a myopathy in the affected males. The reason for the severe cardiomyopathy remained speculative in the absence of dystrophin data on the heart. Regulatory sequences in the 5-prime region of intron 1 deleted in the patients may be of importance for dystrophin expression in various tissues. It was also possible that the deletion in this family affected specifically 1 of the 2 dystrophin actin-binding domains.</Attribute>
