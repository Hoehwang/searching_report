              <Attribute Type="Description">In affected members of 3 unrelated families, 2 French and 1 Italian, with autosomal dominant Parkinson disease (PARK1; 168601), Ibanez et al. (2004) and Chartier-Harlin et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for whole-gene duplication of the SNCA gene. In all patients, the phenotype was typical for idiopathic PD, with a slightly earlier age at onset (39 to 65 years). Affected individuals had bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and a favorable response to levodopa treatment. In contrast to the family with SNCA triplication (see 163890.0003 and Singleton et al., 2003), patients with the SNCA duplication did not have signs of dementia or other atypical features. Ibanez et al. (2004) and Chartier-Harlin et al. (2004) concluded that there was a clear gene dosage effect that correlated with the severity of the disease and suggested that genetic variability within the SNCA promoter may also play a role in the susceptibility to PD.</Attribute>

The length of the duplication in 1 proband was approximately 220 kb, spanning all of SNCA and exons 1-6 of MMRN1 (601456); in the second proband, the duplication was approximately 394 kb, spanning all of SNCA and all of MMRN1. In the first family, 2 patients with the duplication had typical PD, whereas 4 duplication carriers over the age of 43 years were unaffected, yielding a penetrance of 33%. In the second family, 1 affected and 2 asymptomatic members had the duplication. The affected patient from the second family developed dementia 14 years after diagnosis of PD, and neuropathologic examination (Obi et al., 2008) was found to be consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies (127750).</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Fuchs et al. (2007) reported a Swedish kindred with Parkinson disease due to a duplication of the SNCA and MMRN1 genes. Clinical features included autonomic dysfunction and rapidly progressive motor symptoms. Myoclonus and dementia occurred late in the disease. This family was determined to be a branch of a large family originally reported by Mjones (1949). A Swedish American branch of that family was found by Farrer et al. (2004) to have a triplication of the SNCA gene (163890.0003). Fuchs et al. (2007) found that genotypes within and flanking the duplicated region in the Swedish family were identical to genotypes in the Swedish American family reported by Farrer et al. (2004), suggesting a common founder. Hybridization signals indicated a tandem multiplication of the same genomic interval in the 2 families, a duplication and triplication, respectively. Sequence analysis indicated that the multiplications were mediated by centromeric and telomeric long interspersed nuclear element (LINE L1) motifs.</Attribute>

The son had prominent parkinsonism in his late forties, followed by fluctuating cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and deficits in verbal fluency a few years later. The mother presented later at age 72 with memory disturbances and fluctuating cognitive deficits. She then developed mild parkinsonism and visual hallucinations. PET studies showed that both patients had diffuse hypometabolism in the brain that extended to the occipital visual cortex in the mother. Uchiyama et al.

              <Attribute Type="Description">In affected members of 3 unrelated families, 2 French and 1 Italian, with autosomal dominant Parkinson disease (PARK1; 168601), Ibanez et al. (2004) and Chartier-Harlin et al. (2004) identified heterozygosity for whole-gene duplication of the SNCA gene. In all patients, the phenotype was typical for idiopathic PD, with a slightly earlier age at onset (39 to 65 years). Affected individuals had bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and a favorable response to levodopa treatment. In contrast to the family with SNCA triplication (see 163890.0003 and Singleton et al., 2003), patients with the SNCA duplication did not have signs of dementia or other atypical features. Ibanez et al. (2004) and Chartier-Harlin et al. (2004) concluded that there was a clear gene dosage effect that correlated with the severity of the disease and suggested that genetic variability within the SNCA promoter may also play a role in the susceptibility to PD.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Nishioka et al. (2006) identified heterozygosity for duplication of the SNCA gene in 2 of 113 Japanese probands with autosomal dominant PD. The length of the duplication in 1 proband was approximately 220 kb, spanning all of SNCA and exons 1-6 of MMRN1 (601456); in the second proband, the duplication was approximately 394 kb, spanning all of SNCA and all of MMRN1. In the first family, 2 patients with the duplication had typical PD, whereas 4 duplication carriers over the age of 43 years were unaffected, yielding a penetrance of 33%. In the second family, 1 affected and 2 asymptomatic members had the duplication. The affected patient from the second family developed dementia 14 years after diagnosis of PD, and neuropathologic examination (Obi et al., 2008) was found to be consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies (127750).</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Fuchs et al. (2007) reported a Swedish kindred with Parkinson disease due to a duplication of the SNCA and MMRN1 genes. Clinical features included autonomic dysfunction and rapidly progressive motor symptoms. Myoclonus and dementia occurred late in the disease. This family was determined to be a branch of a large family originally reported by Mjones (1949). A Swedish American branch of that family was found by Farrer et al. (2004) to have a triplication of the SNCA gene (163890.0003). Fuchs et al. (2007) found that genotypes within and flanking the duplicated region in the Swedish family were identical to genotypes in the Swedish American family reported by Farrer et al. (2004), suggesting a common founder. Hybridization signals indicated a tandem multiplication of the same genomic interval in the 2 families, a duplication and triplication, respectively. Sequence analysis indicated that the multiplications were mediated by centromeric and telomeric long interspersed nuclear element (LINE L1) motifs.</Attribute>

Only 1 patient had a family history of the disorder; he presented with early onset at age 40 and rapidly progressive disease complicated by dementia. Two of his brothers with the duplication were asymptomatic at 51 and 47 years, respectively, indicating reduced penetrance.</Attribute>

The prevalence of the SNCA duplication in sporadic PD was reported to be 0.25% and 1%, respectively.</Attribute>

              <Attribute Type="Description">Uchiyama et al. (2008) reported a Japanese mother and son with duplication of the SNCA gene associated with variable features of parkinsonism and dementia. The son had prominent parkinsonism in his late forties, followed by fluctuating cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and deficits in verbal fluency a few years later. The mother presented later at age 72 with memory disturbances and fluctuating cognitive deficits. She then developed mild parkinsonism and visual hallucinations. PET studies showed that both patients had diffuse hypometabolism in the brain that extended to the occipital visual cortex in the mother. Uchiyama et al. (2008) noted that the diagnoses in the son and mother were compatible with PD dementia and Lewy body dementia, respectively.</Attribute>
